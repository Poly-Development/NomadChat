## Idiot alert
Who ever keeps deleting the code - Stop trying
because i can restore this stuff at the click of a
button because I am not stupid. To leave this note on a level with a quote from
Forrest Gump; "Stupid is as stupid does."
People on my suspect list are:
  - DannyIsCoding 
  - LTI2
  - WilkeWyoming 
  - dillonjoshua68 (Due to inactivity when i am on)
  hehe im offline most of the time due to school sry - dillonjoshua68 - im offline almost always.
  the last project i did was my weather API
  
  - nonamebyprogram (Can't be too sure.)-

if you want to prove that you are innocent - send a FULL
screenshot of your screen to me (in the forum) if you find the perpetator
doing it. (just click PrtSc which is "print screen")

Otherwise you all listed shall be kicked next time it happens
